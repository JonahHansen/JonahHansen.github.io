								<h1>Antiharassment Policy</h1>
								<p>The LIFE conference organisers are committed to making the meeting productive and enjoyable for all participants, regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical appearance or ability, ethnicity, nationality, religious beliefs, or career status. The meetings are a place for the open exchange of scientific ideas. All professional interactions should be conducted with consideration and respect.</p>

								<p>Harassment of participants in any form will not be tolerated. All participants are expected to follow these guidelines:</p>
								<ul >
									<li>Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. See below for further explication of harassment.	</li>
									<li>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience of people from many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for the subject matter covered by the Rocky Worlds III conference.</li>
									<li> Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Be especially considerate and supportive to those more junior in their careers than yourself.  </li>
								</ul>

								<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination, related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, physical appearance or ability, race, age, or religious beliefs.</li>
								
									<li>Sexual images in public spaces.</li>
								
									<li>Deliberate intimidation, or online stalking.</li>
								
									<li>Harassing photography or recording.</li>
								
									<li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
								
									<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
								
									<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Enforcement</h3>
								
								<p>If behaviour in violation of this code of conduct is witnessed, intervention in the moment is appropriate as long as it respects all parties involved. Panel chairs and moderators bear a particular responsibility to encourage a professional and inclusive environment within their sessions.</p>
								
								<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
								
								<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take action to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender and/or expulsion from the conference.</p>
								
								<p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>
								
								<h3>Reporting</h3>
								
								<p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or you witness someone being made to feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to a member of the organisers or write an email to contact@life-space-mission.com. When taking a personal report you won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.</p>
