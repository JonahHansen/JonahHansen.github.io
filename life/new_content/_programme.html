            <p class="abstract"> The recent upgrade to the Pierre Auger Observatory is an exciting development in ultra-high energy cosmic ray astronomy, with hopes of shedding light on the fundamental questions remaining in the field. Specifically, the addition of a second type of ground based detector aims to better identify the components of cosmic ray induced air showers, providing more information on the composition of these astrophysical messengers. In this talk, I outline my research into exploiting this new upgrade's capabilities and attempt to relate it all back to something a little more down to Earth...reality TV!</p>

            <p class="abstract"> After nearly a decade of continuous operation, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has detected a diffuse isotropic extragalactic gamma-ray background, the origin of which is currently not well constrained, with a number of source candidates suggested (e.g. several types of AGNs, star-forming galaxies, DM annihilation). By using a physical model to determine the properties of cosmic ray transport and the production of gamma-rays in star-forming galaxies (SFGs), we obtain an estimate of the gamma-ray emission originating in SFGs, and by applying this model to a representative deep field galaxy survey we determine their contribution to the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray background.</p>

            <p class="abstract">The MUSE integral field spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope has been very successful in targetted studies of external galaxies. To date, MUSE has been used to target 11,000 fields across the southern sky since it was first commissioned six years ago. We have cross-referenced these data with the LAMOST stellar catalogues and found 84 stars that fall in MUSE fields. We confirm that it is possible to extract stellar parameters from the MUSE data. We present an automated method to extract these parameters for individual stars. Due to the comparable spectral properties (resolving power, spectral band) of the LAMOST and MUSE instruments, we were able to adapt the DD-PAYNE pipeline trained on LAMOST for this purpose. Our methods will enable MUSE, in combination with adaptive optics, to observe stellar parameters in crowded regions of the Galaxy (e.g. clusters, bulge, local disc),something that multi-object spectrographs are severely limited. </p>

            <span class="institution">Macquarie University</span>
            <time>11:40 &ndash; 12:00</time>
            <p class="abstract">Common envelope evolution (CEE) is one of the least understood process in Astrophysics. CEE occurs when, in a binary stellar system, the primary star evolves and overflows its Roche lobe. This can happen via physical expansion of the star or through contraction of the Roche lobe. This, in turn, starts a mass transfer phase between the binary components, and therefore, transport of angular moment. Over time (a few dynamical timescales) the separation between the components decreases and the inspiral phase takes place. In this point the gas of the primary covers both stars and form the common envelope. In this work we put a 2 solar mass primary on the AGB thermal pulse phase in orbit with a 0.6 solar mass white dwarf at Roche Lobe Overflow and allowed them evolve until the core separation reached 30 solar radius. This work explores an unknown region in the energy space parameter that previous works have not been reached. We expected to obtain insight on the evolution of the common envelope, including the final separation of the cores, bound mass and angular momentum transport in this new regime. </p>

            <time>13:15 &ndash; 13:35</time>
            <p class="abstract">Bar plays an important role in mixing material along bars and stimulating radial migration. Previous observations have found evidence for the impact of a bar on metallicity gradient but the effect is still inconclusive. We now use data from the TYPHOON/PrISM survey to investigate the metallicity gradient along the bar and beyond the bar region in five nearby barred galaxies. We find that there is an inner drop of metallicity inside bar region in two galaxies and an outer flattening outside the bar region in another two galaxies. There is one galaxy in our sample who have metallicity gradient showing no change inside and outside the bar region. We investigate the azimuthal variation of metallicity in spiral arms and find the downstream of NGC 1365 has lower metallicity. Our results imply the impact of a bar on radial mixing of material but larger sample observation need to be done for clearer conclusion.</p>

            <h3>Recent progress on anisotropic, magnetised, supersonic turbulence</h3>
            <span class="presenter">James Beattie</span>
            <span class="institution">The Australian National University</span>
            <time>13:35 &ndash; 13:55</time>
            <p class="abstract">The rich structure that we observe in molecular clouds is due to the interplay between strong magnetic fields and supersonic (turbulent) velocity fluctuations. The velocity fluctuations interact with the magnetic field, causing it too to fluctuate. Using numerical simulations, we explore the nature of such magnetic field fluctuations, $\delta\mathbf{B}$, over a wide range of turbulent Mach numbers, $\mathcal{M} = 2 - 20$ (i.e., from weak to strong compressibility), and Alfvén Mach numbers, $\mathcal{M}_{A0} = 0.1 - 100$ (i.e., from strong to weak magnetic mean fields, $B_0$). We derive a compressible quasi-static fluctuation model from the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations and show that velocity gradients parallel to the mean magnetic field give rise to compressible modes in sub-Alfvénic flows, which prevents the flow from becoming two-dimensional, as is the case in incompressible MHD turbulence. We then generalise an analytical model for the magnitude of the magnetic fluctuations to include M, and find $|\delta\mathbf{B}| = \delta B = c_s\sqrt{\pi\rho_0}\mathcal{M}\mathcal{M}_{A0}$, where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $\rho_0$ is the mean density of gas. This new relation fits well in the strong B-field regime. We go on to study the anisotropy between the perpendicular ($ B_{\perp}$) and parallel ($ B_{\parallel}$) fluctuations and the mean-normalised fluctuations, which we find follow universal scaling relations, invariant of $\mathcal{M}$. We provide a detailed analysis of the morphology for the $\delta  B_{\perp}$ and $\delta  B_{\parallel}$ probability density functions and find that eddies aligned with $B_0$ cause parallel fluctuations that reduce $B_{\parallel}$ in the most anisotropic simulations. We discuss broadly the implications of our fluctuation models for magnetised gases in the interstellar medium.</p></div>

            <span class="institution">Queensland University of Technology</span>
            <time>13:55 &ndash; 14:15</time>
            <p class="abstract">Magnetic fields are ubiquitous and play an important role creating structure on all scales in the Universe. While the origin of the first magnetic fields are still somewhat of a mystery, with debate surrounding the mechanisms that could have generated the “primordial” fields, dynamo theory is a physically plausible mechanism that explains how initially tiny, weak seed magnetic fields could have become rapidly amplified by turbulent velocities and sustained with the structure and strength observed in the present Universe. In the “small-scale” turbulent dynamo regime, which is particularly relevant to star-formation, the amplification of magnetic fields occur on scales smaller than the turbulent driving, and an important question becomes identifying the scale on which magnetic fields primarily grow.</p>

We study the properties of the SSD as a function of the nature of turbulent driving, in particular the compressive (curl-free) and the solenoidal (divergence-free) driving. We find that for the lower Mach numbers, the saturation efficiency of the dynamo increases as the Mach number decreases. We apply our results to magnetic field amplification in the early Universe and show that the SSD produces fields compatible with lower limits of the present-day intergalactic magnetic field inferred from blazar gamma-ray observations on scales of 0.1 pc to 100 pc. </p>

            <time>09:50 &ndash; 10:10</time>
            <p class="abstract">The observation of Gravitational Waves (GWs) has marked a new milestone in Multi-Messenger Astronomy. GW detections are often used as ‘sirens’ to alert other astronomical observatories about a potential compact binary merger. The joint detection of GW170817 (GW) and GRB170817A (Gamma Ray Burst) from a Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger is one of the most iconic observations to take place in this decade and the fact that these detections were made mere seconds apart, shows the immense need for a rapid GW detection. Using the current infrastructure, it is impossible to detect GWs, relay information and point the telescopes to a source within seconds. In this talk, I will discuss a new technique being developed to detect GWs from a compact binary before their merger, which would give us ample time to do follow up observations.</p>

          <p class="abstract">I will be talking about the stellar populations in the young and massive star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The traditional picture of stellar populations is that the globular clusters exhibit the simple stellar populations (SSP), meaning they can be represented by single mass, age, and metallicity value. The idea of the globular clusters being a simple population is a view of the past. Recent observations of the young (~ 1 – 2 Gyr) clusters by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown that some of these clusters show the traces of more than one population in terms of star-to-star elemental abundance in them, known as multiple populations (MPs). I am going to talk about whether age of the cluster can become the determining factor for hosting the MPs. Is age just a number in case of star clusters and their populations? </p>

            <p class="abstract">HII regions are the birthplace of stars in galaxies. These newly formed star forming regions emit copious amounts of ionised radiation. Previous studies have shown that analysing the properties of this ionised gas can provide insights into how stars form and evolve and thus galaxy evolution. However, studies of the ISM and properties of the ionised gas in galaxies have not been done on a HII region scale before. In this study, we used IFS data from the TYPHOON/PriSM survey to analyse these HII regions in the highly-resolved nearby irregular dwarf galaxy NGC 3109. We used several methods to select and distinguish HII regions from diffuse ionised gas (DIG) regions, as these DIG regions have been shown in previous studies to affect metallicity and star formation rate measurements in HII regions. After identifying these HII regions, we analysed their physical properties such as flux, velocity dispersion, metallicity, ionisation parameter and ionisation source. We found that the metallicity enrichment is relatively uniform across the galaxy, and across the individual HII regions, which tells us there hasn’t been any recent star formation activity in the galaxy.</p>

            <p class="abstract">As the amount of data collected from large scale astronomical observations continues to increase, the demand for fast and efficient analysis methods is becoming more and more prevalent. Here we present a novel method for the fast and effective calibration of models of large population data. This technique takes in complex models which may be treated as a black box and aims to match the output distributions to the distributions observed in the population. The results show this method is significantly more efficient than more commonly used SMC methods. The use of an information geometry approach is also explored and shows promise for further development in the area of population calibration.</p>
