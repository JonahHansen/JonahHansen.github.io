<h1>This time, on Stromlo Student Seminars...</h1>

The Australian National University Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics is pleased to present the 2020 Mount Stromlo Student Seminars! This two-day conference is designed to be a fun and relaxed event for astronomy and astrophysics research students from all over Australia. The event will give you the chance to network with your peers (and future colleagues), practise your public speaking skills, and learn about a variety of topics.

Your talk doesn't have to be on astronomy! <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/xmas19/programme.html">Past talks</a> have been about everything from planet formation and magnetic fields, to vampires, space interferometry, and even Kickstarter projects!
<br><br>
This year's theme is <b><i>Reality TV</i></b>.
