            <h1>This time, on Stromlo Student Seminars...</h1>

The Australian National University Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics is pleased to present the 2020 Mount Stromlo Student Seminars! This two-day conference is designed to be a fun and relaxed event for astronomy and astrophysics research students from all over Australia. The event will give you the chance to network with your peers (and future colleagues), practise your public speaking skills, and learn about a variety of topics.
<br><br>
Your talk doesn't have to be on astronomy! <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/xmas19/programme.html">Past talks</a> have been about everything from planet formation and magnetic fields, to vampires, space interferometry, and even Kickstarter projects!
<br><br>
This year's theme is <b><i>Reality TV</i></b>.
<br>
<h2>Logistics</h2>

DUE TO COVID-19, THE SEMINARS ARE NOW BEING HELD ONLINE. <br>SPEAKER REGISTRATION IS NOW CLOSED.<br><br>

The seminars will be held on the 26th&ndash;27th November 2020 on the Zoom online platform. Students will have opportunity to present talks on both days of the conference.
We will send through a Zoom link to all registered participants the day before the seminars, with conference proceedings beginning at 9:15am.

<h2>Information for presenters</h2>

The time limit for talks is 15 minutes, with 5 minutes for questions and changeover. You are encouraged to share your exciting research, something funny, or something you find relevant to the theme. Better yet, you can incorporate the theme into your science talk. Prizes will be awarded for the best talks as voted for by the conference attendees.
